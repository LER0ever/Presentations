The problem of writing notes is that it is just too slow to write,
I personally write my notes in my economics class and I end up spending 2 thirds of the class writing thing down,
and sometimes I still have to go to the professor to get the missing parts after class.
Also it is not easy to search on a paper full of notes, especially when you tried to find some concepts from your last year&#x2019;s notes,
it&#x2019;s gonna take forever. And if you choose to type notes, you&#x2019;ll probably find out that the laptop is a huge distraction,
you can do almost everything on it. In fact if you try to sit at the back of a lecture hall,
you can see a lot of ebays, messengers, youtubes or even video games if the lecture hall is large enough.
Also, plenty of research suggests that students don&#x2019;t learn as much when they type notes,
compared to writing notes, which I&#x2019;ll explain in the later slides.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="9" data-x="-9300" data-y="-4100" data-z="21800" id="trifecta" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1"><h3>3 Main Factors Affecting Note Taking Performance</h3>
<hr>
<div class="bg-transparent shadow">
  <ul class="flexblock reasons">
    <li>
      <h2>Selective Filtering Process</h2>
      <p>Filter out the unimportant, pick the part worth taking down</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Fraction of lecture paying attention to the professor</h2>
      <p>
        Time spent on writing notes, surfing the web, or anything other than listening to the professor are excluded

    <li>
      <h2>Amount of notes for later review</h2>
      <p></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div><div class="notes"><p>Then my research went on to the question of what essentially determines the performance or the efficiency of note taking,
and from the papers I read, they all came down to these three main factors. The first one is selective filtering,
the second one is how much time you are actually focusing on the professors&#x2019; speech, the last one is how much you&#x2019;ve got for later review.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="10" data-x="-10300" data-y="-4700" data-z="15800" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1"><h1 id="selective-filtering">1. Selective Filtering</h1><p>Filter out the unimportant, pick the part worth taking down</p><div class="notes"><p>So what is selective filtering. It is a process in which students are actively engaged in filtering out things
that are less important to them and writing down what they think is worth writing down. So basically it&#x2019;s a choosing process.
And this choosing process is proved to actually help us learn much better compared to those who don&#x2019;t have this process
going on when they are attending lectures, this is because by filtering the information, the conceptual understanding of
the material is greatly improved. The next two is quite easy to understand.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="11" data-x="-10300" data-y="-3700" data-z="15800" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1"><h1 id="fraction-of-lecture-paying-attention-to-the-professor">2. Fraction of lecture paying attention to the professor</h1><p>Time spent on writing notes, surfing the web, or anything other than listening to the professor are excluded</p><div class="notes"><p>This means the fraction of time spent on the actual lecture. So that would exclude the time for browsing the web,
chatting on social networks and instant messages, and taking notes. The reason why note taking is excluded as well is
because most of us are not able to multitask, so if say a student is busy writing things down, he or she is not paying full attention to the professor.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="12" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1" data-x="-10300" data-y="-2700" data-z="15800"><h1 id="amount-of-notes-for-later-review">3. Amount of notes for later review</h1><p>The more the better</p><div class="notes"><p>The last factor is the amount of notes for later review, this one is obvious.
If you have more detailed notes to review, especially when it comes to the final week, it&#x2019;s absolutely better than having nothing to rely on.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="13" data-x="-10300" data-y="-3500" data-z="12800" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1"><div class="wrap">

it is not hard to see the downside of our current methods. Students who choose to write notes, will have that choosing process going on,
but they will end up wasting lots of lecture time on writing, and may not have much to refer back to later on.
While those who type their notes may have more notes, more lecture time but they don&#x2019;t have that cognitive process.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="14" data-x="-8300" data-y="-3500" data-z="12800" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="180" data-scale="1"><div class="wrap">

    <hr />
    <h2>2. Livenotes - Collaborative Note Board</h2>
    <h4>Students end up getting lower grades</h4>
    <h2>...</h2>
</div><div class="notes"><p>So since the 21st century, people have been busy coming up with several new ways to help students take better notes,
one of them is OneNote from Microsoft. Basically if you have an ipad or a surface pro, you can just write on OneNote and
it will automatically recognize your scripts using Optical Character Recognition. So I tried that yesterday,
just like the comment I saw in one of the research papers, it is fine if the user write in a straight line in a printed style,
but when I try doing normal note taking stuff like writing equations and drawing graphs, the recognition result just gets really funny.
Another approach is from UC Berkeley, called Livenotes, where students can collaboratively take notes. It&#x2019;s a kind of white board,
with the powerpoint in the middle, and you can scribble all over it, together with other students.
It&#x2019;s really interesting and it turns out that students who use this get lower grades than normal students.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="15" data-x="-9300" data-y="-3500" data-z="9800" data-scale="0.3" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="360"><img src="images/solution-preview.png" alt="solution" width="80%"></img><div class="notes"><p>So what I proposed in my paper, is kind of somewhere between taking notes by hand and using laptops
I call it computer-aided note taking because the laptop will do most of the work and students
only need to select and copy paste what they want. That&#x2019;s a quick demonstration of how it works,
it&#x2019;s a two column layout software, on the right hand side, the content is automatically generated
using real-time speech recognition, and as many of you may notice, I have it here at the bottom of my slides,
it&#x2019;s the same thing, and what students need to do is to select what they want, copy to the left and organize them.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="16" data-x="-9300" data-y="-3500" data-z="10300" data-scale="0.1" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="360"><div class="wrap">

selective filtering process because they have to select from a huge chunk of text, and they can now focus more
on the actual lecture because they no longer need to spend a lot of time taking care of their notes, also,
they have plenty of material for later review, because they get both a complete version of lecture notes
on the right, and their own organized version on the left.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="17" data-x="-7300" data-y="-3000" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="-180" data-rotate-y="180" data-rotate-z="360" data-z="10800"><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Note taking is necessary for college students.</p><p>According to the three factors,
