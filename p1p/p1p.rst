*a.1*  AI Developed Its Own Non-Human Language
==============================================

Two AI bot that are trained to negotiate at facebook eventually create their 
own language to communicate after they have chatted with each other.

* Nothing to do with terminators
* Much potential for future

*a.2*  Possible Research Questions
=========================================

* Positive

    * How can Machine Learning, or more specifically chatting bot, help human rethink the way of communication ?

* Negative

    * How to prevent machine learning from unexpected results under unsupervised learning ?

*b.2*  Main idea of 13b
=========================

Instead of causing job loss, AI actually makes people's job more easier.

We can use AI to help business leaders improve their communication skills.

How? By simulating the audience and giving you feedback.

* Objective judgement

* Comprehensive feedback

Future? Artificial Intelligence Guides Improvements

*b.3*  Possible Research Question
=================================

* Will time be the only factor for people's performance if AI-aided improving is
  widely adopted?

* How will machine learning help people make improvement in efficiency of daily
  work?

*c.1*  Facebook AI Creates Its Own Language In Creepy Preview Of Our Potential Future
======================================================================================

Artificial Intelligence is much better at dealing with patterns of massive data.
Although they may be a potential threat to mankind, we should still proceed with
caution and closely monitor the progress.

----


*c.2*  Possible Research Questions
===================================

* What's the exact situation should we consider machine learning is an actual
  threat to human race?

* Who should take the responsibility if an AI goes out of control? The one who
  build it or the user? (possibly speculative)

*d.1*  What is the future of communication?
===========================================

Smart phones and video conferencing have already made great changes on how
people communicate. And more changes will take place in the future, including
Augmented Reality and brain-computer interfaces.

*d.2*  Possible Research Questions
====================================

* Are people actually more engaged in communication with newly adopted technology
  ?

* How to prevent personal privacy leak with brain-computer interface?
  (possibly too bland)

*e.1*  A Computational Model of Culture-Specific Conversational Behavior
=========================================================================

Research is conducted to study a model that simulates cultural differences
and whether native speakers can tell the differences between simulations of
different culture parameters. The results reveals that people are able to
distinguish between models generated with difference culture parameters,
suggesting that culture-specific behaviors is noticable for both people who
share the same culture and who do not.

*e.2*  Possible Research Questions
======================================

* Can a virtual agent that simulates the cultural difference help people
  communicate better with people under different cultural backgrounds?
  And how?
